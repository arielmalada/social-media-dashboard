the fake api list provided kinda give me idea of facebook profile so i decided to create a bootleg facebook profile dashboard, but there's some flaw i haven't able to solve because the limited time given, little experience with fake API, react router and unexpected personal errand while working this project. despite that, thank you for the opportunity
